# Google Sheet Live View

This is a simple static website that reads a public Google Sheet and refreshes quickly so updates show up fast.

## Quick start

1. Publish your Google Sheet: **File → Share → Publish to the web**.
2. Copy the Sheet ID from the URL (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`).
3. Open `app.js` and update:

```js
const sheetConfig = {
  sheetId: "YOUR_SHEET_ID",
  sheetName: "Sheet1",
  refreshIntervalMs: 10000,
};
```

4. Run a local server and open the page:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Notes

- Keep the first row of the sheet as headers to label the table columns.
- The page uses the Google Visualization endpoint, which is fast and does not require an API key for published sheets.
